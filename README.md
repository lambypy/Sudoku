# Sudoku

Over the past few years, I have occasionally played Sudoku, whether it is through local newspapers or online. Repetition allowed me to complete medium puzzles in a quick time, and knowledge of patterns and techniques pushed me into completing hard puzzles. You can find a link here for daily puzzles to complete:

Further reading of online sudoku puzzles led me to some websites for user-generated sudoku puzzles. It was often difficult to know if these were actually solvable. Today, I decided to build a Sudoku solver to let me know if these puzzles are actually solvable before playing them. The code actually prints out the full Sudoku solution, but an added option allows for it to just let you know if it is solvable without ruining the fun. 

This was created in C++, for the simple fact that I recently started learning C++ and wanted to improve.
