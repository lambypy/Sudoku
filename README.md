# Sudoku

Over the past few years, I have occasionally played Sudoku, whether it is through local newspapers or online. Repetition allowed me to complete medium puzzles in a quick time, and knowledge of patterns and techniques pushed me into completing hard puzzles.

Further reading of online sudoku puzzles led me to some websites for user-generated sudoku puzzles. It was often difficult to know if these were actually solvable.
Take this example below, how do we know that the Sudoku puzzle is solveable?

Unfortnately, there is no way of knowing that the user-generated Sudoku puzzles are valid before playing them. Of course, most websites will check the puzzles before accepting them, but for some websites this is not the case.

So, today I decided to build a Sudoku solver to let me know if these puzzles are actually solvable before playing them. The code actually prints out the full Sudoku solution, but an added option allows for it to just let you know if it is solvable without ruining the fun. 

This was created in C++, for the simple fact that I recently started learning C++ and wanted to improve.
